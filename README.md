# Amber terminal preset for WallpaperEngine

**Requires WallpaperEngine on Steam**

**Beta, terminal contents not fully working at this stage!**

===========================================================================

I decided to rewrite my rainmeter preset into wallpaper engine for performance reasons, and I thought I'd put the source.

Retro styled DEC VT100 terminal desktop, with clock radio. I know the VT100 wasn't amber, but I think it looks better - change it to green if you like..

All WE UI user properties should reflect properly, however actual wallpaper clickables aren't currently working. I hope to get them working at some point; please feel free to message me with how the WE Shared class works, or to fork if you think you can do better.
