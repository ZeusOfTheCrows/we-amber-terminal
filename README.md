# we-amber-terminal
Beta, terminal contents not fully working at this stage!  ===========================================================================  I decided to rewrite my rainmeter preset into wallpaper engine for performance reasons, and I thought I'd put it up on steam workshop.  Retro styled DEC VT100 terminal desktop, with clock radio. I know the VT100 wasn't amber, but I think it looks better - change it to green if you like..  Background image from MaxCorpIndustries[www.deviantart.com], crt effects by Zauwara/fug4life.  ===========================================================================  All WE UI user properties should reflect properly, however actual wallpaper clickables aren't currently working. I hope to get them working at some point; please feel free to message me with how the WE Shared class works, or to request source if you think you can do better.  User properties:      Terminal text colour      Prompt character(s)      Bloom effect (toggle)      Pincushion intensity      Scanline intensity      CRT Noise intensity      Vertical separator (¦)      Clock text colour      Clock trunc'ed/full day
